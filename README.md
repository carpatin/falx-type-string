# Falx Library - String Type 

## A String class implementation that provides native UTF-8 support 

* * *

### Intro

The implementation uses various PHP extensions to provide UTF-8 support for string operations but also implements fallback code to use when a specific PHP extension is not present in a deploy environment. The fallback code uses only core PHP features, so it will run in any PHP installation.

This way you can write your heavy UTF-8 strings operations code using a very inspired operations interface and well thought object oriented library and then run your code with no worries regardless of the hosting's PHP configuration details.
